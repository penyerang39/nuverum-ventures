## Framework & Dependencies:
1. This app uses Next.js 15.5.0 **with the app router** and **turbopack**. Always use the optimal Next.js solution for any implementation (i.e. Next.js specific next/font/google global font imports)
2. This app uses React 19.1.0/React DOM 19.1.0
3. This app uses Tailwind v4 and Tailwind templates, which may be adjusted **if requested** to fit the existing design system
4. This app is hosted on Vercel
5. Use TypeScript by default for all new components and pages
6. Package manager is pnpm, always use pnpm when installing something.

## General Rules:
1. You will only make the changes explicitly requested by the user. If you notice any suboptimal elements that don't follow the rules, you will first **mention it** to the user in the summary, and then if the user explicitly mentions to change it, you will change those elements
2. Always prioritize performance, accessibility, and user experience in implementations
3. Follow the principle of least privilege - only add dependencies and complexity when necessary
4. Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive variable and function names
5. Use consistent styling, ' over " unless necessary, camelCase for components, kebab-case for images, etc. 

## Component Architecture:
1. Create reusable components in `/components` directory with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. Use composition over inheritance - prefer composable components over large monolithic ones
3. Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript interfaces
4. Follow the single responsibility principle - each component should have one clear purpose
5. Use React.memo() for expensive components that don't need frequent re-renders
6. Implement proper error boundaries for component isolation

## State Management:
1. Use React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer) for component-level state
2. Lift state up only when necessary - keep state as local as possible
3. Use Context API sparingly and only for truly global state
4. Implement proper loading and error states for all async operations

## CSS & Styling:
1. When writing text, you will NEVER set custom sizes **unless explicitly requested to**. You will follow global scaling rules set in globals.css
2. If a certain custom text component (or any component like a button is being reused), it must be defined globally in globals.css or in `/components` as a .tsx file
3. When creating pages, ensure they follow consistent padding and margin styling. The gaps between children will be consistent, and global page padding must be universal across all pages
4. The color system defined in globals.css must be followed. If it's incomplete, it must be added following **user requests**
5. Backgrounds must follow the background color or the alternate theme color where either a second theme is toggleable or is part of the default styling of a certain part of a page
6. Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
7. Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary - prefer Tailwind classes or CSS modules
8. Implement dark mode support using CSS custom properties and Tailwind's dark mode utilities
9. NEVER create overly convoluted tailwind or inline values where a simple p- tailwind value can suffice. NEVER do redundant things like pt-3 pb-3 when you can use py-3, NEVER use inline classes when tailwind works.
10.  When dealing with children of rounded components, NEVER round the child if you expect its roundness to follow/be on the edge of the rounded parent div, instead give the parent overflow-hidden and the child rounded-0.

## Responsive Design:
1. You will create scaling elements mobile-first, prioritizing first and foremost optimizing scaling for mobile, and only then adding **Tailwind className breakpoints** to guarantee optimal scaling
2. You will ONLY use inline scaling elements where **ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY** and you must justify each usage
3. You will not add excessive scaling systems or container divs which may inadvertently cut off parts of the content
4. If the user's request is minimal - implement minimal changes. If the user's request is large in scope, use a todo list and complete each part of the user's request thoroughly
5. Test responsive behavior at common breakpoints (mobile: 375px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px+)
6. Ensure touch targets are at least 44px for mobile accessibility

## Performance Optimization:
1. Implement proper image optimization using Next.js Image component
2. Use dynamic imports for code splitting when appropriate
3. Implement proper caching strategies with Next.js built-in caching
4. Minimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies, if dependencies are very large (over 500kb), propose calling them through a server side api instead where possible.
5. Use Suspense boundaries for async components
6. Implement proper preloading for critical resources

## Data Fetching & API:
1. Use Next.js App Router data fetching patterns (fetch with caching)
2. Implement proper error handling for all API calls
3. Use TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
4. Implement proper loading states and optimistic updates where appropriate
5. Cache API responses appropriately using Next.js built-in caching

## Security:
1. Sanitize all user inputs
2. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Implement proper CORS policies
4. Use HTTPS everywhere and secure headers
5. Validate and sanitize any user-generated content

## Code Quality:
1. Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
2. Implement proper error logging and monitoring **when requested**
3. Document complex logic with clear comments

## File Organization:
1. Follow Next.js App Router file structure conventions
2. Group related files together (components, hooks, utilities)
3. Use index files for clean imports
4. Separate concerns: UI components, business logic, data fetching
5. Keep file sizes reasonable (under 300 lines when possible)

## Version Control:
1. Don't make commits, don't run development servers, don't merge, don't touch git.  DO NOT RUN BUILD, DO NOT RUN DEV
